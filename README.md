Project nÂ°5 of OpenClassrooms Web Developer training : Building an e-commerce website. 

## Getting started

### Back-end : Install and launch the back-end server

First, you need the back-end server running. It is not included directly in this project.
You need to clone the [back-end repository](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/JWDP5), and follow its installation and launch instructions.

### Front-end : Open the Website

Once the back is running, you can simply open the `index.html` file (located at the root of this repository) in your browser.
